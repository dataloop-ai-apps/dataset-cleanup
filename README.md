# Data Cleanup App

A Dataset Tab App for Cleaning Datasets

## Prerequisites

Before using the app, ensure you have installed an embeddings model into your Dataloop datasets. This step is crucial for enabling the similarity check functionality.

## Overview

The Data Cleanup App offers three main functionalities to help you clean and organize your datasets efficiently:

### 1. Similarity Check

-   **Cluster Similar Images**: Group similar images into clusters based on chosen similarity metrics.
-   **Find Duplicates**: Easily identify and manage duplicate images within your dataset.
-   **Dataset Actions**: Perform various dataset actions on the clustered or duplicate images, such as deletion or categorization.

### 2. Darkness/Brightness Detection

-   **Identify Bright Images**: Detect and list images with high brightness levels.
-   **Identify Dark Images**: Detect and list images with low brightness levels.
-   **Dataset Actions**: Take necessary actions on bright or dark images to improve dataset quality.

### 3. Blurriness/Sharpness Detection

-   **Identify Blurred Images**: Detect images that are out of focus or blurred.
-   **Identify Sharp Images**: Detect images that are clear and well-focused.
-   **Dataset Actions**: Manage blurred or sharp images accordingly to ensure dataset integrity.

With these functionalities, the Data Cleanup App simplifies the process of maintaining high-quality datasets, making it an essential tool for any data-driven project.
